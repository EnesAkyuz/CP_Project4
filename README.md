About this web app: An app that lets you create, edit, delete, name and customize your cars. Fully supported with option limitations when incompatible parts are chosen, and with error handling in the case of invalid part submissions. With seperate edit, view, details and create pages.

Time spent: 11 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->

- [X] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured `CustomCar` table**
  - [X] **NOTE: Your GIF must include a view of your Railway database that shows the contents of the table used by your app**
- [X] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [X] **Users can view a list of options they can select for different aspects of a `CustomCar`**
- [X] **On selecting each option, the displayed visual icon for the `CustomCar` updates to match the option the user chose**
- [X] **The user can submit their choices to save the car to the list of created `CustomCar`**
- [X] **If a user submits a feature combo that is impossible, they should receive an appropriate error message and the item should not be saved to the database**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Selecting particular options prevents incompatible options from being selected even before form submission

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] For the customizations menu, I created state handlers so that the borders of the already selected options looked different. Giving the users a more seamless experience.
- [X] I also changed the icons for the choices, which is based on the selection option to be different in colors for better distinguishability.
- [X] Created a scrollable customization modal pop-up so that if more options get added, we do not have to change the styling.
